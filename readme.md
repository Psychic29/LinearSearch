# linear Search

<p>Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. It is the easiest searching algorithm.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[].</li>
  <li>If x matches with an element, return the index.</li>
  <li>If x doesnâ€™t match with any of the elements, return -1.</li>
</ul>
