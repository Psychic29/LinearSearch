# Linear Search

`This repository is open for hacktoberfest contributions.`

Linear Search is defined as a `sequential` search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. It is the `easiest` searching algorithm.

- Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[].
- If x matches with an element, return the index.
- If x doesnâ€™t match with any of the elements, return -1.
